Some very basic steps to get started:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

On a Debian server, you can install everything you need with the following commands:

```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    docker.io \
    docker-compose
```

### Tegon setup

Clone the [Tegon docker repository](https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

This will start supertokens, typesense, postgres database and redis in docker. 

### Server setup

```bash
cd server
yarn 
```

Create a `.env` file inside server folder by copying the content from `.env.example`. We use openAI for our AI features. Setup your OpenAI account as described [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)
and add the key to `.env` file

```bash
yarn migrate:dev
yarn start:dev
```

In a new tab now we can run commands to create necessary workspace, team and users. 

```bash
node scripts/createUserWorkspaceTeam
```

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
yarn 
yarn dev
```
Now you can access the app at http://localhost:3000
