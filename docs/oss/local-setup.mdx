###  Cloning the docker Repository

To streamline your setup, we recommend using our Docker repository, which comes pre-configured with essential services like Supertokens, Typesense, Redis, and PostgreSQL. 
This setup also includes the server and webapp, making it easier to manage everything in one place.

#### Steps:

1. **Install Docker:** Make sure Docker is installed on your workstation, and ensure you're using the latest version of Docker Compose. [See instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Clone the Docker Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/docker.git
cd docker
```

3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the start script

```bash
./start.sh
```


<Note>
If you plan to work on the server or frontend locally, you can comment out the corresponding services in the Docker setup or adjust the ports as needed.

###  Cloning the Tegon Repository

Once Docker is set up, you can proceed with cloning the Tegon repository to start development.

#### Steps:

1. Clone the Tegon Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon.git
cd tegon
```

2. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


3. Run Migrations and Start Development Server:
