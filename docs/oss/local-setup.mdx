## Instructions

1. Install Docker on your workstation (see instructions). Make sure you're on the latest version of docker-compose.

2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/docker.git
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon.git
cd docker
```

3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the start script and follow the prompts, We handle 2 major steps in start script setting up trigger.dev and setting up tegon for you. 

```bash
./start.sh --dev
```

5. Now go to server folder in the tegon folder

```bash
cd ../tegon/server
yarn
```

6. Create a `.env` file inside server folder by copying the content from `.env.example`. We use openAI for our AI features. Setup your OpenAI account as described [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)
and add the key to `.env` file

```bash
yarn migrate:dev
yarn start:dev
```

7. In a new tab now we can run commands to create necessary workspace, team and users. 

```bash
node scripts/createUserWorkspaceTeam
```
8. Now you can move to frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
yarn 
yarn dev
```


5. Now you can access the app at http://localhost:3000
