###  Cloning the docker Repository

To streamline your setup, we recommend using our Docker repository, which comes pre-configured with essential services like Supertokens, Typesense, Redis, and PostgreSQL. 
This setup also includes the server and webapp, making it easier to manage everything in one place.

#### Steps:

1. **Install Docker:** Make sure Docker is installed on your workstation, and ensure you're using the latest version of Docker Compose. [See instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Clone the Docker Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/docker.git
cd docker
```

3. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the start script

```bash
./start.sh
```


<Note>
If you plan to work on the server or frontend locally, you can comment out the corresponding services in the Docker setup or adjust the ports as needed.
</Note>


###  Cloning the Tegon Repository

Once Docker is set up, you can proceed with cloning the Tegon repository to start development.

#### Steps:

1. Clone the Tegon Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon.git
cd tegon
```

2. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

4. Run Migrations and Start Development Server:

```bash
pnpm migrate
pnpm dev
```

5. The first time you set this up, you will be greeted with a login screen. Unless you have SMTP credentials in your `.env` file
  - Enter your email and click `Send Magic Link`. 
  - Navigate to server logs from the previous step to find the magic link. Copy and paste that url to override local authentication
