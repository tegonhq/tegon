1. Install Docker on your workstation (see instructions). Make sure you're on the latest version of docker-compose.

2. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tegonhq/tegon.git
cd tegon
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Create user using the following commands

```bash
docker exec -ti tegon-server sh
node scripts/createUserWorkspaceTeam
```

You will find something like this

```bash
Welcome to the User, Workspace and Team creation Script!
Is this initial setup (yes/no): yes
Enter your email:
Enter your password:
User created successfully
```

You can create workspace with the same command (say no as initial setup)

```bash
Options:
1. Create Workspace
2. Create Team
3. Create Multiple users
4. Add Users to workspace and team
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 2
Enter the workspace name:
Enter the team name:
Enter the team identifier:
Team created successfully.
```

Similarly run the command to create team, workspace and users.

4. You can now check tegon at `http://localhost:8000`
