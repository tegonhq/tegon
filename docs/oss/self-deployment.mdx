## Caveats

This guide outlines a quick way to start self-hosting Tegon. Scaling, security, and reliability concerns are not fully addressed here. It's unlikely to result in a production-ready deployment on its own, but it's a good starting point.

Should the burden ever get too much, we'd be happy to see you on [Tegon.ai cloud](https://app.tegon.ai) where we deal with these concerns for you.

<Accordion title="Please consider these additional warnings">
- We use trigger.dev for the background jobs this there is a little bit of extra work to deploy the jobs
- We are also restricted by the limitations of trigger.dev in scaling. You can check those in their [documentation](https://trigger.dev/docs/v3/open-source-self-hosting#caveats).
