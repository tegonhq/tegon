We have a cli to deploy the actions. In the folder where you find `config.json`. You can run 

```bash
TOKEN=<token-id> npx @tegonhq/cli deploy --workspace-id="<workspace-id>"
```

For token you can go to [dashboard](https://app.tegon.ai), then `Settings` -> `Personal -> API` and generate a new PAT which you can use.
