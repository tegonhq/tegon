**Tegon Actions** is a powerful framework designed to automate repetitive tasks in issue tracking, streamlining your workflow. 
Whether it’s automatically labeling issues or creating sub-issues for PR reviews, Tegon Actions helps you eliminate manual processes.

But Tegon Actions doesn’t just stop at basic workflows—it integrates seamlessly with other tools you use in issue tracking. For example, 
you can automate the creation of issues directly from Slack and sync slack threads by simply using an emoji.

What truly sets Tegon Actions apart is its ability to transform your issue tracker into a dynamic system of actions rather than just a static database. 
Imagine a workflow where, every time a bug is created, an intelligent agent reviews the codebase, conducts a basic web search, and suggests potential solutions as comments in the issue. 
This kind of agentic workflow is now possible with Tegon Actions which elevates your issue tracking to a new level of efficiency and intelligence.

There are different types of actions including regular triggers, intergration based triggers and scheduled triggers.
