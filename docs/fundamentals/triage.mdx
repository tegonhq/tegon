## Overview

Triage is your central hub for managing incoming requests. It acts as a one-stop shop, capturing issues from various sources beyond your team. Integrate with GitHub issues, CRMs, support platforms, or even capture requests raised directly in Slack by team members.


## Perfect for

- Sales & Customer Support: Effortlessly capture feature requests from prospects and customers, and log bugs reported by users - all within Triage.
- Open Source Management: Efficiently manage GitHub issues alongside other incoming requests.
- Automated Monitoring: Automatically route errors detected by monitoring tools into the triage queue for prioritisation.


## Key Benefits

- Consolidated Inbox: Save time and eliminate manual effort by having all requests (support, sales, business, monitoring tools) flow into a single, organised location.
- Seamless Collaboration: Bidirectional sync functionality ensures you can track updates directly within the relevant Slack thread where the request originated. This fosters smoother communication and follow-up.
- Enhanced User Experience: Empower non-technical users to comfortably submit requests through their preferred channel - Slack.


## Review & Manage Triage Issues

- Scan & Assess: Quickly glance through the issue list one by one.
- Clarify & Discuss: Need more information? Comment on the thread directly in Slack (if integrated) to request clarification.
- Action Decisions:
-- Decline: If the request is irrelevant or invalid, you can decline it.
-- Accept: For valid requests, accept them and decide on their status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress"). You can also modify metadata like assignee or priority.
