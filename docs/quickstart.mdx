## Tegon

Tegon is an AI-first, open-source issue tracking software that uses AI to smartly automate manual task, workflows or provide more context to engineers for a given task.

### Cloud

If you would like to join our waiting list for onboarding, please email us at harshith@tegon.ai. We are onboarding new customers every week and would be happy to have you join us!. 
Once you are onboarded, it's a matter of signin and you are good to go. 

### Self-hosted

If you prefer to self-host Tegon on your own machine, you can do so using Docker. However note that you will need to add configurations for email, AI and storage services. 
Please refer to the documentation [here](/oss/deploy-tegon)
