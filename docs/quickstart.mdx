## Overview

Tegon is an AI-first, open-source issue tracking software that uses AI to smartly automate manual task, workflows or provide more context to engineers for a given task.

### Cloud

Tegon cloud is currently in public beta, you can signup [here](https://app.tegon.ai/auth)

### Self-hosted

If you prefer to self-host Tegon on your own machine, you can do so using Docker. However note that you will need to add configurations for email, AI and storage services.
