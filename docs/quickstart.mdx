Tegon is the dev-first issue tracking software powered by the open-source community. It is simple, light-weight and customisable.
### Cloud

### Self-hosted

If you prefer to self-host Tegon on your own machine, you can do so using Docker. However note that you will need to add configurations for email, AI and storage services.
