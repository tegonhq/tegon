## Key Benefits

- Focus on What's Important: Easily create custom views using filters to see exactly what you need.
- Save Time & Collaborate: Save your favourite views for quick access and share them with your team. This streamlines collaboration and ensures everyone's on the same page (e.g., dedicated bug report view).
- Revisit & Analyze: Saved views make it easy to revisit filtered lists of issues for ongoing analysis and progress tracking.
