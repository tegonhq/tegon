## Overview

An issue is a clearly defined, manageable unit of work. This could involve tasks like documenting specific requirements, writing a portion of code, or fixing a minor bug. Each issue should be specific enough to understand the goal and its contribution to project progress.

If an issue involves multiple tasks that need independent tracking, break it down into sub-issues. This ensures clarity and allows you to monitor the progress of each smaller step within the larger issue.


## Create an issue

- Open the Create Issue Screen: Press the keyboard shortcut `C` or click the `+` icon in the bottom left corner of the left-side navigation bar.
- AI-generated Title: The system will automatically generate a title based on your description. Focus on providing a well-defined explanation of the issue.
- AI-powered Assistance: As you write, the system will suggest relevant labels and assignees to streamline the creation process.


## Edit an issue

All workspace members can edit the title and description of any issue. This allows for clear communication and ensures everyone has the latest information. Feel free to refine the AI-suggested title or add details to the description for better clarity.


## Boards Layouts

Teams can view the issues with two interactive layouts - List and Kanban
- Interactive Views: Both layouts let you directly update key details like status, assignee, and priority with a simple click.
- Focus on What Matters: Important information like sub-tasks and blocked/blocking issues are highlighted for quick identification, keeping you on top of critical dependencies.

### List View

Perfect for scanning issues. See them displayed in an ordered list, grouped by status by default. Need to focus? Collapse sections to streamline your view.

### Kanban View

Ideal for visualising workflow. Group issues in a Kanban board format, typically by status, for a quick assessment of progress.
