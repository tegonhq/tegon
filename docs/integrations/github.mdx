## Overview

Tegon seamlessly integrates with GitHub to keep your development process in sync:

- Effortless Linking: Connect your pull requests (PRs) to related Tegon issues. Once a PR is closed, the linked Tegon issue automatically updates to "done."
- Automated Issue Creation: New GitHub issues automatically create corresponding Tegon issues in triage, saving you time and effort.
- Bidirectional Sync: Changes made in either platform (Tegon or GitHub) automatically reflect in the other. This includes issue closure, comments, and other updates, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.


## Configure - cloud version

### For PR Linking

1. Navigate to Settings -> Workspace -> Integrations -> GitHub.
2. Connect your personal GitHub account to Tegon.
3. Select the desired GitHub organisation you want to connect.
4. Choose to connect all repositories or select specific ones you want to sync.
5. Click the Install and Authorise button to finalise the connection. 

### For Automated issue creation

1. After completing steps 1-5, select the specific GitHub repository you want to link with your Tegon team. This enables automatic creation of Tegon issues when new issues are created in GitHub.
2. For two-way synchronization (changes reflected in both Tegon and GitHub), enable bi-directional sync. Otherwise, only GitHub issues will sync to Tegon.
