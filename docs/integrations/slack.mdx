## Overview

Effortlessly integrate Tegon with Slack to transform your project communication and management:

1. Create Issues from Slack Messages:
- Use the "..." menu on any Slack message to effortlessly create a Tegon issue.

2. Automate Issue Creation with Emoji 👀:
- Assign 👀 emoji to a Slack thread to automatically trigger Tegon AI to create a triage issue.
- This feature empowers even non-Tegon users to easily report issues.

3. Synchronized Conversation Threads:
- When issues are reported in Slack, a synced comment thread is automatically created within the corresponding Tegon issue.
- Tegon comments are automatically reflected in the Slack thread, keeping everyone in the loop and vice versa.
- Both the Slack thread and the Tegon comments update in real-time, ensuring everyone stays on the same page regardless of their chosen platform.
