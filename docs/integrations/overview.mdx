Tegon seamlessly integrates with the tools you already use, keeping you productive and in the zone. Say goodbye to frustrating app switching! Currently, Tegon connects with GitHub, Slack, and Sentry. We're constantly adding new integrations based on user feedback (like yours!).

We're committed to making Tegon your one-stop shop for project management. Feel free to suggest a new integration by creating a GitHub issue - we value your input!
