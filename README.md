    <em> Tegon is AI-First Issue Tracking tool for engineering teams
</em>
</p>

[Tegon](https://tegon.ai) is an AI-first, open-source issue tracking software that uses AI to smartly automate manual task, workflows or provide more context to engineers for a given task.

Issue Tracking is important for fast-paced teams, enabling them to organize list of tasks, collaborate, and track progress effectively. However, existing tools often introduce the following challenges:

- Manual efforts in task management, such as task triaging and backlog maintenance, can be time-consuming.
- Engineers often waste time navigating multiple platforms to gather task context, rather than accessing details within the task itself.
- Issue tracking tools serve as a task database, directing engineers on what to work on but not aiding in faster task completion.
- Existing tools don't effectively assist Engineering Managers in real-time task, feature, or bug prioritisation.

## Self Hosted

To self-host Tegon on your own machine, you can do so using Docker. However note that you will need to add configurations for email, AI and storage services. Please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.tegon.ai/oss/self-deployment).

## Tegon Cloud

We offer a managed cloud version of Tegon that allows you to run Tegon without having to manage the infrastructure. It is currently in private beta.
If you're interested in using Tegon Cloud, please book a [demo call](https://calendly.com/manik-tegon/30min).
